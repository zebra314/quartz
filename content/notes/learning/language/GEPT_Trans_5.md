These plates always squeeze each other and accumulate energy. When a plate wins the fight with another plate, all energy is released immediately. This is the origin of earthquake. Taiwan, locating between to plate, is not strange to earthquake. Because of this unique geographical feature, Taiwan experience about two thousand times of earthquakes every year, but only nine percent of the earthquakes can be felt. Therefore, a lot of buildings in Taiwan nowadays, such as Taipei 101, is built in consideration of earthquake safety. They must be strong enough to resist against the fierce shaking.
