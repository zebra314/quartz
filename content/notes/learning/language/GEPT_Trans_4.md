## Content : 
> Normally, the winter in Taiwan has been relatively cold and wet, however the winter that just passed through was not. The precipitation was not as much as before and there was no any typhoon last year. As result, the water level decrease to dangerous level. The lack of water caused serious drought to the island. A wild fire in mountain Ali lasted for many days because the dry plantation was burning very easily. The condition of Sun Moon lake was also terrible. A part of the lake had dried out which makes the whole lake looks like a desert. The government in mid Taiwan had no choice but to implement water rationing to beat the drought which was most serious in the past ten years.
