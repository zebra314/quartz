## Topic
Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past. 

## Content
Nowadays, the technology develops rapidly and by using it properly, technology could be a great tool for children to learn and become more creative.  

Internet is one of the important technology, it enables us access to many sorts of information and content easily. With the platform like Youtube, Pinterest and other educational websites, children can learn skills and ideas by watching videos and articles. The knowledge they can acquire on the internet is more than that in the classroom, also their horizon no longer limit to surroundings but extend to all over the world. 

Additionally, Technology provides many approaches for children to express their inspiration.  Children can learn to manipulate the software like Blender and Photoshop through the Internet, and use them to create digital art, including 3D models, paintings and animations. By using these types of tool, children are able to bring their ideas to life more effectively in comparison to the traditional mediums.  

In my opinion,  technology helps children gain more ideas and become more creative than they were in the past.
