In recent years, many frog species around the world have declined in numbers or even gone extinct due to changes in their environment. These population declines and extinctions have serious consequences for the ecosystems in which frogs live; for example, frogs help play a role in protecting humans by eating disease-carrying insects. Several methods have been proposed to solve the problem of declining frog populations.

First, frogs are being harmed by pesticides, which are chemicals used to prevent insects from damaging farm crops such as corn and sugarcane. Pesticides often spread from farmland into neighboring frog habitats. Once pesticides enter a frogâ€™s body, they attack the nervous system, leading to severe breathing problems. If laws prohibited the farmers from using harmful pesticides near sensitive frog populations, it would significantly reduce the harm pesticides cause to frogs.

A second major factor in frog population decline is a fungus that has spread around the world with deadly effect. The fungus causes thickening of the skin, and since frogs use their skin to absorb water, infected frogs die of dehydration. Recently, researchers have discovered several ways to treat or prevent infection, including antifungal medication and treatments that kill the fungus with heat. Those treatments, if applied on a large scale, would protect sensitive frog populations from infection.

Third, in a great many cases, frog populations are in decline simply because their natural habitats are threatened. Since most frog species lay their eggs in water, they are dependent on water and wetland habitats. Many such habitats are threatened by human activities, including excessive water use or the draining of wetlands to make them suitable for development. If key water habitats such as lakes and marshes were better protected from excessive water use and development, many frog species would recover.

## Content
The passage mentions three methods to save the frogs from declining and extinction, whereas the lecturer casts doubt on the feasibility of these methods.

To begining with, the author claims that the frogs are sensitive to the peticides and their nervous system may be damaged by the peticides easily. Therefore the author suggests that the government to implement laws to perhibit the usage of peticides which endanger the frogs. The lecturer disagrees on preventing the usage of peticides, because without the peticides, the farmers will face the disadvantage of lossing the crops. Hence, perhibition of peticides is not economically pratical.

Moreover, the fungus are also harmful to the frogs, the author mentions that using medical and heat treatment to kill the fungus and save the frogs from infection. However, the lecturer claims that the treament can only take effect on single frog each time,  means that those treaments need to apply on each indivisual frog and each generation. Therefore, the treament is too difficult to implement.

Finally, the author points out that the declining of the wetland, the habitat of frog, directly cause the amount of the frog to decline. To protect the frog's habitats, the author states that reducing the excessive water usage may solve the problem. However, the lecturer disputes the passage by attributing the main reason of declining habitats to global warming, this implies that reducing water usage is not going to save the habitats from destroied.

In conclusion, the author provides some methods aiming at save the frogs, such as perhibition of peticide, the antifungal treamen and reducing the excessive water usage, while the lecturer disputes these methods by emphasizing that economic loss of farmers if not using the peticides, the difficulty to implement the treament to frogs and the unrelation of excessive water usage and the destory of frog's habitats.

## Revision 
### Chatgpt
The passage mentions three methods to save the frogs from declining and extinction, whereas the lecturer casts doubt on the feasibility of these methods.

To begin with, the author claims that frogs are sensitive to pesticides, and their nervous systems may be easily damaged by pesticides. Therefore, the author suggests that the government implement laws to prohibit the usage of pesticides that endanger the frogs. The lecturer disagrees with preventing the usage of pesticides because, without pesticides, farmers will face the disadvantage of losing crops. Hence, the prohibition of pesticides is not economically practical.

Moreover, fungi are also harmful to frogs. The author mentions using medical and heat treatment to kill the fungi and save the frogs from infection. However, the lecturer claims that the treatment can only take effect on a single frog each time, meaning that these treatments need to be applied to each individual frog and each generation. Therefore, the treatment is too difficult to implement.

Finally, the author points out that the declining wetlands, the habitat of frogs, directly cause the decline in the frog population. To protect the frog's habitats, the author states that reducing excessive water usage may solve the problem. However, the lecturer disputes the passage by attributing the main reason for declining habitats to global warming. This implies that reducing water usage is not going to save the habitats from being destroyed.

In conclusion, the author provides some methods aiming to save the frogs, such as the prohibition of pesticides, antifungal treatment, and reducing excessive water usage. The lecturer disputes these methods by emphasizing the economic loss for farmers if pesticides are not used, the difficulty of implementing treatment on frogs, and the unrelated nature of excessive water usage to the destruction of frog habitats.
