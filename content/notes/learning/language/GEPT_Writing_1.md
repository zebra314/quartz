## Content : 
> Without expertise, people won’t able to solve the problem or finish the task, even though they have good soft skills. Soft skills would help the event to progress more smoothly, but it cannot replace the importance to expertise. 

> Taking my part time job for example, I worked in a robot development team during last summer vacation, and mainly responsibled for the programming of the robot’s user interface. When I found a bug inside the code, I needed to solved it with my skills and knowledge. Indeed, the soft skills such as communication and work in a team make my works much easier, but without them, I could still finish the work on my own. However, without the expertise such as the coding ability and mechanical knowledge, I would not even pass the interview and get this job. 

> Talking to the soft skill I hope to develop the most, it is the skill of time management. Before the project starts, we normally divide the project into many small part, priortize the tasks and assign them into the schedule, then we will follow the timeline and do our best to complete the project on time. With well time management, we could know what to do at the moment and be able to handle any accident calmly.
