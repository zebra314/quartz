8.

(a) Draw a typical current-voltage curve for a fuel cell operating at 25°C. Calculate the theoretical voltage and mark as a horzontal line. Label the three regions that control the fuel cell performance and give brief explanations of their causes.
Answer: The three regions are activation, ohmic, and concentration polarization. The activation polarization is caused by the activation overpotential. The ohmic polarization is caused by the ohmic overpotential. The concentration polarization is caused by the concentration overpotential.

(b)Repeat the question for a high temperature fuel cell operating at 800°C.
Answer: The three regions are activation, ohmic, and mass transport polarization. The activation polarization is caused by the activation overpotential. The ohmic polarization is caused by the ohmic overpotential. The mass transport polarization is caused by the mass transport overpotential.
