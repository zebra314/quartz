High school life is typically filled with exams and homework, making it challenging for students to explore the world. Claire raises a crucial point about the financial aspect of a gap year, expressing concern that some students may struggle to afford tuition. However, in addition to family support, there are alternative means of financial assistance, such as part-time jobs or government subsidies.
