## Content : 
> When the visitors of Taipei take Taipei MRT, they might notice the interesting phenomenon about the escalator. People standing at the right side normally, leave the left side for people in hurry to use. When MRT started to operate over twenty years ago, the government implemented a regulation to ask the tourists to stand by the right side. However, an accident in 2005 made the government cancel this regulation and only recommended the tourists to hold the handler tightly and stand stably at the steps. Still, many Taipei citizens follow this original regulation unconsciously. But, for safety, the most proper way is standing on the both sides of the escalator.
