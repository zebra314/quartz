## Bug fixes  
- Fix"[ WARN] [1688953266.307205756]: Couldn't set gain on joystick force feedback: Bad file descriptor"   
	- Change the path of joystick in config file from ```/dev/input/js0``` to ```/dev/input/js2```     
- ```/cmd_vel``` not receive the data in ```/joy_teleop/cmd_vel```   
	- ```<remap from="/joy_teleop/cmd_vel" to="/cmd_vel" />```      
- ```/cmd_vel``` receive the data from joystick, but the data is not correct to which is set in the config file   
	- use ```rostopic echo /joy_teleop/joy``` to view the original data receive from joystick and correct the index of button.   
	- For example, if the L1 button is pressed and the topic echo changes from ```buttons: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]``` to ```buttons: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]```, then we can infer that L1 button has the index of 4.
